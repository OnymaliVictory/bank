🔟 Design System (Suggested)

Since this is a bank:

Primary color: Deep Blue

Accent: Gold

Background: Soft gray / white

Font: Inter / Poppins

Rounded cards

Smooth animations

1️⃣1️⃣ Frontend States to Plan For

Very important:

Loading

Success

Error

Empty data

Disabled actions

1️⃣2️⃣ Frontend Data Flow (No Backend Yet)
User submits form
→ Show loading
→ Fake success (for now)
→ Redirect


Later:

Replace fake data with Supabase/Firebase responses

✅ What I Can Build Next (Your Choice)

I can now:

1️⃣ Create full HTML structure for all pages
2️⃣ Design login & register UI (bank-grade)
3️⃣ Build dashboard UI with animations
4️⃣ Create CSS design system (global.css)
5️⃣ Make it fully responsive (mobile first)

👉 Reply with the number(s) you want next.
I recommend starting with 2 + 3 together for momentum 🚀





Now we move into real banking UI.

Choose next:

1️⃣ User Dashboard UI (account overview)
2️⃣ Connect register.html → Supabase Auth
3️⃣ Connect login.html → Supabase Auth
4️⃣ Add loading + success + error states

👉 I recommend 1️⃣ Dashboard UI next, then we wire Supabase cleanly after.

Reply with the number — we continue immediately 💳✨
